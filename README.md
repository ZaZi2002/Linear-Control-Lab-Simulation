# Linear Control Systems Laboratory

This repository contains the solutions to the control systems laboratory assignments. The lab exercises involve both MATLAB scripting and Simulink modeling for analyzing and designing control systems. Below are the details for each homework assignment.

## Homework 1: MATLAB Signal Analysis and System Modeling

### Part A: Signal Reconstruction

### Part B: LTI Models

## Homework 2: Simulink Model Simulation

### Part A: Simulink Model Construction

### Part B: Closed-Loop System Simulation

### Part C: Data Analysis

### Controller Design

1. Suggest a controller for achieving zero steady-state error in response to a step input.
2. Design a controller to meet these requirements:
   - Zero steady-state error to a unit step input.
   - Overshoot less than 10%.
   - Settling time less than 4 seconds.
3. Use your controller in Simulink, plot the unit step response, and check if it meets expectations. Adjust parameters if necessary.
4. Construct the block diagram in Figure 3 and integrate your controller. Plot the unit step responses for the closed-loop systems.
